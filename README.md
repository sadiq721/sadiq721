👋 Hi there! I'm Shaik Sadiq, a passionate Data Science enthusiast with a keen interest in solving real-world problems using data. I recently completed my academic journey and I'm now focused on applying machine learning and data analysis to uncover insights and drive impactful decisions.


🔍 I enjoy exploring data, cleaning messy datasets, finding patterns, and building predictive models using tools like *Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and **Seaborn*. I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new algorithms and techniques.


📊 My academic projects and internships have helped me gain hands-on experience in:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Model Evaluation and Optimization


🚀 I'm excited to kickstart my career in Data Science and looking forward to contributing to innovative projects. Whether it's building models, working with data pipelines, or collaborating on open-source, I'm ready to learn and grow.
